    <h3>Description</h3>
    <img src="../recipePhotos/dolma.webp" alt="Picture of sarma">
    <p>Sarma, commonly marketed in the English-speaking world as stuffed grape leaves, stuffed vine leaves, or stuffed cabbage leaves, 
        is a food in Southeastern European and Ottoman cuisine made of vegetable leaves rolled around a filling of grains (such as rice), minced meat, or both. The vegetable leaves may be cabbage, patience dock, collard, grapevine, kale or chard leaves. 
        Sarma is part of the broader category of stuffed dishes known as dolma.</p>
    <p>A grapevine leaf roll is a dish consisting of cooked grapevine leaves wrapped around a variety of fillings. 
        Stuffed vine leaves without meat are sometimes called yalancı dolma, which means "liar's dolma" in Turkish. Vişneli yalancı dolması is a variation of stuffed vine leaves where the rice is seasoned with cinnamon, allspice, and mint. 
        The dolmas are slowly cooked together with morello cherries (vişne), 
        and plums may be used also.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 onions, minced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups hot water, or as needed to cover</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried currants</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried mint</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) jar grape leaves, drained and rinsed in warm water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in rice, then add enough hot water to cover. 
            Cover and simmer until rice is halfway cooked, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and stir in tomato paste, currants, pine nuts, cinnamon, mint, dill, allspice, and cumin. 
            Let mixture cool, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare a large pot by placing an inverted plate on the bottom; 
            this will protect the dolmas from direct heat during steaming.</li>
        <li>Cut off and discard any grape leaf stems. Place about 1 teaspoon cooled rice mixture into the center of a leaf. Fold in the sides, then roll into a cigar shape. 
            Place into the prepared pot. Repeat to make remaining dolmas.</li>
        <li>Pour in just enough warm water to reach the bottom of the first layer of dolmas. Cover and simmer over low heat for 30 to 45 minutes, or until rice is totally cooked. 
            Check the water level often and add more as necessary.</li>
    </ol>
